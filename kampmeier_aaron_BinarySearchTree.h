/**
 * Manages a Binary Search tree with nodes that store a templated payload type. Nodes are hidden to the user; the user
 * cannot access or manipulate them directly. The only public interfaces operate on "payloads" which are the values
 * nodes store in this BST.
 *
 * There should be no assumed organization of how the BST stores its payloads nor should there be any modification of
 * payload data directly in a way that would change its relative position to other payloads. The BST is free to
 * reorganize nodes / re-structure the tree at any time it sees fit.
 *
 * Modifying Payloads: The only changes allowed to payloads are ones that don't change its relative position to other
 * payloads. If any payload needs to be modified in a way that would change its position in the tree, it should be
 * removed and re-inserted. To make a safe change to a payload one must use the updatePayload(T*, void(T*)). See
 * method documentation for more information.
 *
 * @tparam T The type that this BST stores instances of in its nodes. T must be comparable, i.e. have the <, >, and ==
 * 	operators defined on it.

	 * A node is intended to be a simple wrapper around a payload with connections to the next left and right
	 * children. Nodes are married to their payloads at instantiation and never separated until destruction. In other
	 * words, payloads will never be shuffled in and out of nodes or around the tree separate from a node. If a
	 * payload needs to move, so will it's enclosing node. If a payload is being deleted, so will it's node. To this
	 * end, there is no need for the payload to be referenced by a pointer (T*) as that only implies the payload
	 * could be changed separate from the node.
