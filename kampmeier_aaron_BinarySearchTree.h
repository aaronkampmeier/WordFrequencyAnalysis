/**
 * Manages a Binary Search tree with nodes that store a templated payload type. Nodes are hidden to the user; the user
 * cannot access or manipulate them directly. The only public interfaces operate on "payloads" which are the values
 * nodes store in this BST.
 *
 * Payloads are organized within the tree based on their Storage Key. Constructing the tree requires a pointer to a
 * function that takes in a payload and returns its storage key. The storageKeyFor function must be pure and injective.
 *
 * There should be no assumed organization of how the BST stores its payloads nor should there be any modification of
 * payload data directly in a way that would change its relative position to other payloads. The BST is free to
 * reorganize nodes / re-structure the tree at any time it sees fit.
 *
 * Modifying Payloads: The only changes allowed to payloads are ones that don't change its position relative to other
 * payloads. If any payload needs to be modified in a way that would change its position in the tree, it should be
 * removed and re-inserted. To make a safe change to a payload one must use the updatePayload(T*, void(T*)). See
 * method documentation for more information.
 *
 * @tparam T The type that this BST stores instances of in its nodes.

	 * children. Nodes are married to their payloads at instantiation and never separated until destruction. In other
	 * words, payloads will never be shuffled in and out of nodes or around the tree separate from a node. If a
