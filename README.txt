Welcome to Aaron Kampmeier's Word Frequency Analysis program!

To run this program cd into the directory level of this README file, make sure there exists an "out" directory, and then
 simply run "make". To run, execute "./out/Assignment_4".

You can also run "make clean" to clean up the build dir.

Some automatic tests are provided by running "make tests" and then "./out/run_tests".

There is also a CMakeLists file if you prefer to use CMake.
